## 🔧 Configuration

Before running the code, you need to create a file named `config.json` in the root directory of the project.

### ✅ `config.json` Format

```json
{
  "config_path": {
    "web_url": "https://your-custom-url.com/"
  }
}
```

### 📌 Notes:
- Replace `"https://your-custom-url.com/"` with the URL of the website you want the script to work with.
- Make sure the JSON is valid and correctly formatted.

### 📍 Example

```json
{
  "config_path": {
    "web_url": "https://myanimelist.net/"
  }
}
```
